A brief and engaging description of your project goes here. Highlight its main features and what problem it solves.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Python:** Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can check your Python version by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

* **pip:** Python's package installer. It usually comes bundled with Python.

### Installation

Follow these steps to install the necessary dependencies:

1.  **Install Dashscope:** This library allows your Python environment to interact with Alibaba Cloud's Model Studio.
    ```bash
    pip install dashscope
    ```

2.  **(Optional) Install Streamlit:** If your project includes a user interface built with Streamlit, install it using:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit
    ```
    Alternatively, you can install both Dashscope and Streamlit in a single command:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit dashscope
    ```

### Configuration

You will need to configure your API key to authenticate with Alibaba Cloud.

* **API Key:** You will need an API key from Alibaba Cloud to securely connect to their services. Treat this key as a secret password and do not share it publicly. You will likely need to set this as an environment variable or within your application's configuration.

### Running the Code

To execute the main script of your project, use one of the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
python3 starter_code.py
